    Dear Bestie,
    <br>
    You are so special for me. I can't explain in words how much you mean to me but you're the one I'm afraid of losing and the one I want to keep in my life <br>
    <br>
    My dearest, purest and rarest best friend, I love you from the core of my heart. We met by chance, and now we are best friends by choice. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. I am grateful to God a thousand times for bringing you into my life and making me complete. <br>
    <br>
