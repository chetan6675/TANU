    <h1>Earlier we met on Instagram, we didn't know when the little things turned into completely different things and every single thing started getting shared. <br>
        Even in such a distance, there were feelings of living together, talking together with the song, we both had got so mixed as if we are old friends. <br>
        While both of us had never seen each other nor had we heard a voice, yet our bond had become like a bhatura without chole. <br>
        Then we heard your voice for the first time on pubg, then we started playing different games everyday, you never let me feel that we are on long distance. <br>
        Then due to the end of your recharge, I got your number and later started talking on calls, chatting on WhatsApp but we had not forgotten Instagram. <br>
        Then we both became friends from stronger and slowly from friends to best friends and our bond became stronger.
