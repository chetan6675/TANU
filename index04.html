<h3>The weather was also with us in the long drive, our talks are going on and we are roaming around the whole city, both of us were so happy at that time. <br>
    No tension about anything, nothing, enjoying the movement, it seemed like just kept talking and roaming around <br>
    Then we went to have tea, that too in the evening, the cup of tea had also changed, the weather of that time, the sky was open at night and we talked, what was that evening. <br>
    The happiness that I got at that time, I have not felt like that till date. <br>
    But didn't end just like that even after that such memorable movements were made which we can never forget and when we live with you it feels so good. <br>
