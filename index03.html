   <h3>I saw you on Instagram first then I messaged you I didn't think you would reply but you did</h3> <br>
   <h3>Then we started talking something about you, something about me and then we had good bonding.</h3> <br>
   <h3>Then we started listening to songs together and started talking</h3> <br>
   <h3>Then our numbers exchanged calls and played pubg Started listening to video songs, started dedicating songs to each other</h3> <br>
